/** I2C bus write data
 *
 * According to datasheet (8.1.5.1) the I2C-bus interface gives access to write data and command into the device. Please refer to Figure for
 * the write mode of I2C-bus in chronological order.
 *
 * S
 * [011110(SA)(r/w)] ack
 * [(Co)(D/C)(Control bites(6))] (ack) [Data byte] (ack)   \
 * [(Co)(D/C)(Control bites(6))] (ack) [Data byte] (ack)    - m >= 0 words
 * [(Co)(D/C)(Control bites(6))] (ack) [Data byte] (ack)   /
 * [(Co)(D/C)(Control bites(6))] (ack) [Data byte] (ack)   every [...] -- 1 byte
 * [(Co)(D/C)(Control bites(6))] (ack) [Data byte] (ack)   [Data byte] -- should be n >= 0
 * [(Co)(D/C)(Control bites(6))] (ack) [Data byte] (ack)   MSB.....LSB
 * [Data byte] (ack) [Data byte] (ack) [Data byte] (ack)
 * [Data byte] (ack) [Data byte] (ack) [Data byte] (ack)

 *
 * [011110(SA)(r/w)]                -- SSD1306 slave address
 * [(Co)(D/C)(Control bites(6))]    -- Control byte
 *
 * 1. The master device initiates the data communication by a start condition.
 *    The start condition is established by pulling the SDA from HIGH to LOW while the SCL stays HIGH.
 * 2. The slave address is following the start condition for recognition use. For the SSD1306, the slave
 *      address is either “b0111100” or “b0111101” by changing the SA0 to LOW or HIGH (D/C pin acts as
 *      SA0).
 * 3. The write mode is established by setting the R/W# bit to logic “0”.
 * 4. An acknowledgement signal will be generated after receiving one byte of data, including the slave
 *      address and the R/W# bit. The acknowledge bit is defined as the SDA line is pulled down during the HIGH
 *      period of the acknowledgement related clock pulse.
 * 5. After the transmission of the slave address, either the control byte or the data byte may be sent across
 *      the SDA. A control byte mainly consists of Co and D/C# bits following by six “0” ‘s.
 *          a. If the Co bit is set as logic “0”, the transmission of the following information will contain
 *             data _bytes_ only.
 *          b. The D/C# bit determines the next data byte is acted as a command or a data. If the D/C# bit is
 *             set to logic “0”, it defines the following data byte as a command. If the D/C# bit is set to
 *             logic “1”, it defines the following data byte as a data which will be stored at the GDDRAM.
 *              The GDDRAM column address pointer will be increased by one automatically after each
 *              data write.
 * 6. Acknowledge bit will be generated after receiving each control byte or data byte.
 * 7. The write mode will be finished when a stop condition is applied. The stop condition is also defined
 *      in Figure 8-8. The stop condition is established by pulling the “SDA in” from LOW to HIGH while
 *      the “SCL” stays HIGH.
 *
 *      @param spec -- should be DATAONLY or COMMAND
 *
 *      Note: if you choose DATAONLY then a few bytes CAN follow that
 *      Note(2): In fact it doesn't really matter what that datasheet has got written in. Every command can be sended
 *      only one way: with set address and begin i2c transmission for EVERY single byte. It means that if you have
 *      3 byte command you MUST send each of them separatelly byte per byte in start->address->cmd-zero->byte->ack sequences.
